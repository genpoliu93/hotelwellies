      "Hotel Wellies opened in July 2013 as a European-style hideaway in the healing mountain resort of Karuizawa, about an hour by train from Tokyo. We help you create fun, friendly, and relaxing memories. Enjoy tea or drinks at the bar (pub) for an experience as if you were in the UK. Chris, the British owner who came to Japan in 1984, speaks English and a bit of unique Japanese. The hotel has been stylishly renovated in recent years, with each room individually designed like a boutique.",
